We experimented with the toy model with $d = 5$ and
\begin{equation*}
x_A = \begin{pmatrix}%
0.5&0.6&0.0&0.0&0.0%
\end{pmatrix},
r_A = 0.02,
d_A = 0.05,
r_{\tilde{A}} = 0.1
\end{equation*}
for target $A$, and
\begin{equation*}
x_B = \begin{pmatrix}%
-0.7&0.0&0.0&0.0&0.0%
\end{pmatrix},
r_B = 0.04,
d_B = 0.075,
r_{\tilde{B}} = 0.15
\end{equation*}
for target $B$.  We refer the reader to appendix \ref{sec:energy_function} for details on the energy function, as well as the actual parameters we used in our experiments.
