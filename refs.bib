               Pande, Vijay S",
  abstract  = "Simulating the conformational dynamics of biomolecules is
               extremely difficult due to the rugged nature of their free
               energy landscapes and multiple long-lived, or metastable,
               states. Generalized ensemble (GE) algorithms, which have become
               popular in recent years, attempt to facilitate crossing between
               states at low temperatures by inducing a random walk in
               temperature space. Enthalpic barriers may be crossed more easily
               at high temperatures; however, entropic barriers will become
               more significant. This poses a problem because the dominant
               barriers to conformational change are entropic for many
               biological systems, such as the short RNA hairpin studied here.
               We present a new efficient algorithm for conformational
               sampling, called the adaptive seeding method (ASM), which uses
               nonequilibrium GE simulations to identify the metastable states,
               and seeds short simulations at constant temperature from each of
               them to quantitatively determine their equilibrium populations.
               Thus, the ASM takes advantage of the broad sampling possible
               with GE algorithms but generally crosses entropic barriers more
               efficiently during the seeding simulations at low temperature.
               We show that only local equilibrium is necessary for ASM, so
               very short seeding simulations may be used. Moreover, the ASM
               may be used to recover equilibrium properties from existing
               datasets that failed to converge, and is well suited to running
               on modern computer clusters.",

  title     = "Is Hairpin Formation in {Single-Stranded} Polynucleotide
               {Diffusion-Controlled}?",
  author    = "Ansari, Anjum and Kuznetsov, Serguei V",
  abstract  = "An intriguing puzzle in biopolymer science is the observation
               that single-stranded DNA and RNA oligomers form hairpin
               structures on time scales of tens of microseconds, considerably
               slower than the estimated time for loop formation for a
               semiflexible polymer of similar length. To address the origin of
               the slow kinetics and to determine whether hairpin dynamics are
               diffusion-controlled, the effect of solvent viscosity ($\eta$)
               on hairpin kinetics was investigated using laser
               temperature-jump techniques. The viscosity was varied by
               addition of glycerol, which significantly destabilizes hairpins.
               A previous study on the viscosity dependence of hairpin dynamics
               (Wallace et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000, 98, 5584),
               in which all the changes in the measured rates were attributed
               to a change in solvent viscosity, reported an apparent scaling
               of relaxation times ($\tau$r) on $\eta$ as $\tau$r ∼ $\eta$0.8.
               In this study, we demonstrate that if the effect of viscosity on
               the measured rates is not deconvoluted from the inevitable
               effect of change in stability, then separation of $\tau$r into
               opening ($\tau$o) and closing ($\tau$c) times yields erroneous
               behavior, with different values (and opposite signs) of the
               apparent scaling exponents, $\tau$o ∼ $\eta$-0.4 and $\tau$c ∼
               $\eta$1.5. Under isostability conditions, obtained by varying
               the temperature to compensate for the destabilizing effect of
               glycerol, both $\tau$o and $\tau$c scale as ∼$\eta$1.1$\pm$0.1.
               Thus, hairpin dynamics are strongly coupled to solvent
               viscosity, indicating that diffusion of the polynucleotide chain
               through the solvent is involved in the rate-determining step.",

               conformational changes that underlie two-state folding, we have
               investigated experimentally the effects of changing solvent
               viscosity on the refolding of the IgG binding domain of protein

               indicate that the rate-limiting conformational changes of the

               and lack any significant ``internal friction'' arising from
               intrachain collisions. When compared with the previously
               determined solvent viscosity dependencies of other, more
               restricted conformational changes, our results suggest that the

              combine with S-protein to form ribonuclease S analogues:
              initially, S-peptide is disordered whereas S-protein is folded.
              The fluorescent probe provides a convenient spectroscopic probe
              for the reaction. The association rate constant, kon, and the
              dissociation rate constant, koff, were both determined for two
              sets of mutants. The dissociation rate constant is measured by
              adding an excess of unlabeled S-peptide analogue to a labeled
              complex (RNaseS*). This strategy allows kon and koff to be
              measured under identical conditions so that microscopic
              reversibility applies and the transition state is the same for
              unfolding and refolding. The first set of mutants tests the role
              of the alpha-helix in the transition state. Solvent-exposed
              residues Ala-6 and Gln-11 in the alpha-helix of native RNaseS
              were replaced by the helix destabilizing residues glycine or
              proline. A plot of log kon vs. log Kd for this series of mutants
              is linear over a very wide range, with a slope of -0.3,
              indicating that almost all of the molecules fold via a transition
              state involving the helix. A second set of mutants tests the role
              of side chains in the transition state. Three side chains were
              investigated: Phe-8, His-12, and Met-13, which are known to be
              important for binding S-peptide to S-protein and which also
              contribute strongly to the stability of RNaseS*. Only the side
              chain of Phe-8 contributes significantly, however, to the
              stability of the transition state. The results provide a
              remarkably clear description of a folding transition state.",

  abstract  = "Functionally relevant transitions between native conformations
               of a protein can be complex, involving, for example, the
               reorganization of parts of the backbone fold, and may occur via
               a multitude of pathways. Such transitions can be characterized
               by a transition network (TN), in which the experimentally
               determined end state structures are connected by a dense network
               of subtransitions via low-energy intermediates. We show here how
               the computation of a TN can be achieved for a complex protein
               transition. First, an efficient hierarchical procedure is used
               to uniformly sample the conformational subspace relevant to the
               transition. Then, the best path which connects the end states is
               determined as well as the rate-limiting ridge on the energy
               surface which separates them. Graph-theoretical algorithms
               permit this to be achived by computing the barriers of only a
               small number out of the many subtransitions in the TN. These
               barriers are computed using the Conjugate Peak Refinement
               method. The approach is illustrated on the conformational switch
               of Ras p21. The best and the 12 next-best transition pathways,
               having rate-limiting barriers within a range of 10 kcal/mol,
               were identified. Two main energy ridges, which respectively
               involve rearrangements of the switch I and switch II loops, show
               that switch I must rearrange by threading Tyr32 underneath the
               protein backbone before the rate-limiting switch II
               rearrangement can occur, while the details of the switch II

              is a challenging task since typical atomistic simulations are at
              least two orders of magnitude shorter. Markov State Models (MSMs)
              provide one means of overcoming this gap without sacrificing
              atomic resolution by extracting long time dynamics from short
              simulations. MSMs coarse grain space by dividing conformational
              space into long-lived, or metastable, states. This is equivalent
              to coarse graining time by integrating out fast motions within
              metastable states. By varying the degree of coarse graining one
              can vary the resolution of an MSM; therefore, MSMs are inherently
              multi-resolution. Here we introduce a new algorithm
              Super-level-set Hierarchical Clustering (SHC), to our knowledge,
              the first algorithm focused on constructing MSMs at multiple
              resolutions. The key insight of this algorithm is to generate a
              set of super levels covering different density regions of phase
              space, then cluster each super level separately, and finally
              recombine this information into a single MSM. SHC is able to
              produce MSMs at different resolutions using different super
              density level sets. To demonstrate the power of this algorithm we
              apply it to a small RNA hairpin, generating MSMs at four
              different resolutions. We validate these MSMs by showing that
              they are able to reproduce the original simulation data.
              Furthermore, long time folding dynamics are extracted from these
              models. The results show that there are no metastable on-pathway
              intermediate states. Instead, the folded state serves as a hub
              directly connected to multiple unfolded/misfolded states which
              are separated from each other by large free energy barriers.",

              inroads to help elucidate biomolecular processes in-silico.
              Despite enormous advances in molecular dynamics techniques and
              the available computational power, many problems involve long
              time scales and large-scale molecular rearrangements that are
              still difficult to sample adequately. In this review we therefore
              summarise recent efforts to fundamentally improve this situation
              by decoupling the sampling of the energy landscape from the
              description of the kinetics of the process. Recent years have

              molecular conformations by dispensing with the details of the
              short-term kinetics of the process. Because these methods

              complemented by techniques to reconstruct the kinetics of the

              important in stabilizing these low-dimensional diffusive searches

               interface sampling (TIS), based on the measurement of effective
               fluxes through hypersurfaces in phase space. TIS improves
               efficiency with respect to standard transition path sampling
               (TPS) rate constant techniques, because it allows a variable
               path length and is less sensitive to recrossings. The second

               algorithms can suffer from ergodicity problems, and we introduce

               swapping, stochastic configurational bias Monte Carlo shooting

               discuss classical isomerization reactions of small nonrigid
               molecules in liquid solvents. Molecular expressions are derived
               for a macroscopic phenomenological rate constant. The form of
               several of these equations depend upon what ensemble is used
               when performing averages over initial conditions. All of these
               formulas, however, reduce to one final physical expression whose
               value is manifestly independent of ensemble. The validity of the
               physical expression hinges on a separation of time scales and

               involves three steps. First, one should know the behaviour of
               all molecules present in the system during the reaction, how
               they will move, and which products they will yield when
               colliding with definite velocities, etc. Practically, this
               amounts in most cases to the construction of the energy surface
               for the reacting system. Professor Eyring told us about the
               results which can be obtained by the application of quantum
               mechanics to molecular systems for this part of the theory. The
               second step in the theory I would call the statistical part. It
               endeavours to solve the problem of the rate of elementary
               reactions. Assuming only the material on the left side of a
               chemical equation to be present in a vessel, and the molecules
               of these to have the Maxwell-Boltzman energy and velocity
               distribution, one wants to know how many molecules corresponding
               to the right side of the equation will be formed in unit time.
               The elementary properties of the molecules are supposed to be
               known in this second step and one wants to express the reaction
               rate of elementary reactions in terms of these. The present
               paper will be devoted entirely to this second step. The third
               step is the consideration of the co-operation of the various
               elementary reactions, which may occur beside and must occur
               after each other in order to complete a real reaction. In
               especially favourable cases there is only one important chain of
               reactions leading to the final products and this has one link
               which is so much slower than all the others, that it is made
               responsible for the observed rate. The others are then assumed
               to be so much faster that one has practically equilibrium
               between the two sides of their chemical equations.",

  title    = "The nature of protein folding pathways",
  author   = "Englander, S Walter and Mayne, Leland",
  abstract = "How do proteins fold, and why do they fold in that way? This
              Perspective integrates earlier and more recent advances over the
              50-y history of the protein folding problem, emphasizing
              unambiguously clear structural information. Experimental results
              show that, contrary to prior belief, proteins are multistate
              rather than two-state objects. They are composed of separately
              cooperative foldon building blocks that can be seen to repeatedly
              unfold and refold as units even under native conditions.
              Similarly, foldons are lost as units when proteins are
              destabilized to produce partially unfolded equilibrium molten
              globules. In kinetic folding, the inherently cooperative nature
              of foldons predisposes the thermally driven amino acid-level
              search to form an initial foldon and subsequent foldons in later
              assisted searches. The small size of foldon units, ∼ 20 residues,
              resolves the Levinthal time-scale search problem. These
              microscopic-level search processes can be identified with the
              disordered multitrack search envisioned in the ``new view'' model
              for protein folding. Emergent macroscopic foldon-foldon
              interactions then collectively provide the structural guidance
              and free energy bias for the ordered addition of foldons in a
              stepwise pathway that sequentially builds the native protein.
              These conclusions reconcile the seemingly opposed new view and
              defined pathway models; the two models account for different
              stages of the protein folding process. Additionally, these
              observations answer the ``how'' and the ``why'' questions. The
              protein folding pathway depends on the same foldon units and
              foldon-foldon interactions that construct the native structure.",

              between two pre-specified sets A and B, i.e. the portionsof the
              path of a Markov process during which the path makes a transition
              from A to B. This problem is relevant e.g. in the context of
              metastability, in which case the two sets A and B are metastable
              sets, though the formalism we propose is independent of any such
              assumptions on A and B. We show that various probability
              distributions on the reactive trajectories can be expressed in
              terms of the equilibrium distribution of the process and the
              so-called committor functions which give the probability that the
              process reaches first B before reaching A, either backward or
              forward in time. Using these objects, we obtain (i) the
              distribution of reactive trajectories, which gives the proportion
              of time reactive trajectories spend in sets outside of A and B;
              (ii) the hitting point distribution of the reactive trajectories

              the surface when they cross it; (iii) the last hitting point

              the probability current of reactive trajectories, the integral of
              which on a surface gives the net average flux of reactive

However, the rates of this ergodicity are not well understood, especially in the regime of very high-dimensional sets. Here we present new bounds on these rates for convex sets with a given diameter. Our bounds do not depend upon the smoothness of the boundary nor the value of the ambient dimension, n.",

  abstract  = "This monograph provides a concise presentation of a mathematical
               approach to metastability, a wide-spread phenomenon in the
               dynamics of non-linear systems - physical, chemical, biological
               or economic - subject to the action of temporal random forces
               typically referred to as noise, based on potential theory of
               reversible Markov processes. The authors shed new light on the
               metastability phenomenon as a sequence of visits of the path of
               the process to different metastable sets, and focuses on the
               precise analysis of the respective hitting probabilities and
               hitting times of these sets.The theory is illustrated with many
               examples, ranging from finite-state Markov chains,
               finite-dimensional diffusions and stochastic partial
               differential equations, via mean-field dynamics with and without
               disorder, to stochastic spin-flip and particle-hop dynamics and
               probabilistic cellular automata, unveiling the common universal
               features of these systems with respect to their metastable
               behaviour. The monograph will serve both as comprehensive
               introduction and as reference for graduate students and
               researchers interested in metastability.",

              is based on the idea that ensembles of three-dimensional
              fragments extracted from high-resolution crystal structures are
              heterogeneous enough to describe metastable as well as
              intermediate states. These ensembles are first validated by
              performing a quantitative comparison against available solution

              folding simulations. The new method couples a high-resolution
              model for accuracy and a low-resolution model for efficiency. It
              aims to overcome the entropic barrier found in the exponentially
              large protein conformational space when a high-resolution model,
              such as an all-atom molecular mechanics force field, is used. The
              proposed method is designed to satisfy the detailed balance
              condition so that the Boltzmann distribution can be generated in
              all sampling trajectories in both high and low resolutions. The
              method was tested on model analytical energy functions and ab
              initio folding simulations of a beta-hairpin peptide. It was
              found to be more efficient than replica-exchange method that is
              used as its building block. Analysis with the analytical energy
              functions shows that the number of energy calculations required
              to find global minima and to converge mean potential energies is
              much fewer with the new method. Ergodic measure shows that the
              new method explores the conformational space more rapidly. We
              also studied imperfect low-resolution energy models and found
              that the introduction of errors in low-resolution models does
              decrease its sampling efficiency. However, a reasonable increase
              in efficiency is still observed when the global minima of the
              low-resolution models are in the vicinity of the global minimum
              basin of the high-resolution model. Finally, our ab initio
              folding simulation of the tested peptide shows that the new
              method is able to fold the peptide in a very short simulation
              time. The structural distribution generated by the new method at

  abstract  = "Milestoning is a method for calculating kinetics and
               thermodynamics of long time processes typically not accessible
               for straightforward Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. In the
               Milestoning approach, the system of interest is partitioned into
               cells by dividing hypersurfaces (Milestones) and transitions are
               computed between nearby hypersurfaces. Kinetics and
               thermodynamics are derived from the statistics of these
               transitions. The original Milestoning work concentrated on
               systems in which a one-dimensional reaction coordinate or an
               order parameter could be identified. In many biomolecular
               processes, the reaction proceeds via multiple channels or
               following more than a single-order parameter. A description
               based on a one-dimensional reaction coordinate may be
               insufficient. In the present paper, we introduce a variation
               that overcomes this limitation. Following the ideas of
               Vanden-Eijnden and Venturoli on Voronoi cells that avoid the use
               of an order parameter (J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 130, 194101), we
               describe another way to ``Milestone'' systems without a reaction
               coordinate. We examine the assumptions of the Milestoning
               calculations of mean first passage times (MFPT) and describe
               strategies to weaken these assumptions. The method described in
               this paper, Directional Milestoning, arranges hypersurfaces in
               higher dimensions that ``tag'' trajectories such that efficient
               calculations can be done and at the same time the assumptions
               required for exact calculations of MFPTs are satisfied
               approximately. In the original Milestoning papers, trajectories
               are initiated from an equilibrium set of conformations. Here a
               more accurate distribution, that mimics the first hitting point
               distribution, is used. We demonstrate the usage of Directional
               Milestoning in conformational transitions of alanine dipeptide
               (in vacuum and in aqueous solution) and compare the correctness,

              common approach is to describe the system dynamics in terms of
              transitions between coarse partitions of conformational space. In
              contrast to previous work that partitions the space according to
              geometric proximity, the authors examine here clustering based on
              kinetics, merging configurational microstates together so as to
              identify long-lived, i.e., dynamically metastable, states. As
              test systems microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of the
              polyalanines Ala(8) and Ala(12) are analyzed. Both systems
              clearly exhibit metastability, with some kinetically distinct
              metastable states being geometrically very similar. Using the
              backbone torsion rotamer pattern to define the microstates, a
              definition is obtained of metastable states whose lifetimes
              considerably exceed the memory associated with interstate
              dynamics, thus allowing the kinetics to be described by a Markov

              the hydrogen-bonding pattern fails to identify long-lived

              approach is proposed to generate a hierarchical model of

  abstract = "Characterizing the equilibrium ensemble of folding pathways,
              including their relative probability, is one of the major
              challenges in protein folding theory today. Although this
              information is in principle accessible via all-atom molecular
              dynamics simulations, it is difficult to compute in practice
              because protein folding is a rare event and the affordable
              simulation length is typically not sufficient to observe an
              appreciable number of folding events, unless very simplified
              protein models are used. Here we present an approach that allows
              for the reconstruction of the full ensemble of folding pathways
              from simulations that are much shorter than the folding time.
              This approach can be applied to all-atom protein simulations in
              explicit solvent. It does not use a predefined reaction
              coordinate but is based on partitioning the state space into
              small conformational states and constructing a Markov model
              between them. A theory is presented that allows for the
              extraction of the full ensemble of transition pathways from the
              unfolded to the folded configurations. The approach is applied to
              the folding of a PinWW domain in explicit solvent where the
              folding time is two orders of magnitude larger than the length of
              individual simulations. The results are in good agreement with
              kinetic experimental data and give detailed insights about the
              nature of the folding process which is shown to be surprisingly
              complex and parallel. The analysis reveals the existence of
              misfolded trap states outside the network of efficient folding
              intermediates that significantly reduce the folding speed.",

  abstract = "The identification of metastable states of a molecule plays an
              important role in the interpretation of molecular simulation data
              because the free-energy surface, the relative populations in this
              landscape, and ultimately also the dynamics of the molecule under
              study can be described in terms of these states. We compare the
              results of three different geometric cluster algorithms (neighbor
              algorithm, K-medoids algorithm, and common-nearest-neighbor
              algorithm) among each other and to the results of a kinetic
              cluster algorithm. First, we demonstrate the characteristics of
              each of the geometric cluster algorithms using five
              two-dimensional data sets. Second, we analyze the molecular
              dynamics data of a beta-heptapeptide in methanol--a molecule that
              exhibits a distinct folded state, a structurally diverse unfolded
              state, and a fast folding/unfolding equilibrium--using both
              geometric and kinetic cluster algorithms. We find that geometric
              clustering strongly depends on the algorithm used and that the
              density based common-nearest-neighbor algorithm is the most
              robust of the three geometric cluster algorithms with respect to
              variations in the input parameters and the distance metric. When
              comparing the geometric cluster results to the metastable states
              of the beta-heptapeptide as identified by kinetic clustering, we
              find that in most cases the folded state is identified correctly
              but the overlap of geometric clusters with further metastable
              states is often at best approximate.",

  abstract  = "Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful tool for modeling both
               the thermodynamics and kinetics of molecular systems. In
               addition, they provide a rigorous means to combine information
               from multiple sources into a single model and to direct future
               simulations/experiments to minimize uncertainties in the model.
               However, constructing MSMs is challenging because doing so
               requires decomposing the extremely high dimensional and rugged
               free energy landscape of a molecular system into long-lived
               states, also called metastable states. Thus, their application
               has generally required significant chemical intuition and
               hand-tuning. To address this limitation we have developed a
               toolkit for automating the construction of MSMs called
               MSMBUILDER (available at https://simtk.org/home/msmbuilder). In
               this work we demonstrate the application of MSMBUILDER to the
               villin headpiece (HP-35 NleNle), one of the smallest and fastest
               folding proteins. We show that the resulting MSM captures both
               the thermodynamics and kinetics of the original molecular
               dynamics of the system. As a first step toward experimental
               validation of our methodology we show that our model provides
