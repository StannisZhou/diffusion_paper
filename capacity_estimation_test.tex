Take $r_A = 0.1, r_{\tilde{A}} = 0.4$, and $d_A = 0.2$. We can then compare the exact capacity for this case with the capacity given by our capacity estimation algorithm:

\begin{description}
\item[Exact value]  $ 0.080210 $. This is the capacity given by the analytical formula.
\item[Estimate from capacity estimation algorithm]  $ 0.078846 $. To obtain this value we use the version of the capacity estimation algorithm described in the previous section, with parameter values given by 
\begin{equation*}
m = 2, n = 4, 
N_p = 100, N_b = 3,
N_s = 1000
\end{equation*}
We used a 1e-06 time step.
